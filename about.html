					My honors years consisted of advanced Physics and a research project. My research project was titled "machine learning for finding rare gems in a deluge of astronomical spectroscopic data". The project involved, using machine learning to identify outliers in astronmical data, this was achieved in python using jupyter. The machine Leanring techniques I used were Self organising maps, Principle component analysis and tSNE.
