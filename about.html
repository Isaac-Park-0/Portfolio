			</h1><br/>
			<p>I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science with a HD average at Swinburne University of Technology under a STEM scholarship.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I am a dedicated and conscientious worker and love tackling solutions to complex challenges. I have strong problem-solving skills and a passion for gaming, game development, programming, AI and machine learning. I’ve been coding in my spare time for several years now, and I am quite comfortable with Python. I have also been quickly learning HTML CSS and JavaScript to hone my skills as a front-end developer.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="timelineBody">
						My Honors year consisted of an advanced Physics and a research project titled "machine learning for finding rare gems in a deluge of astronomical spectroscopic data". The project involved using machine learning to identify outliers in astronomical data and was achieved in python using Jupyter. The machine learning techniques applied were Self Organising Maps, Principal Component Analysis and tSNE.
